    * MAJOR BUG - simple subclasses of subclasses of Class::DBI would not 
      work.  This has been fixed.
    * Autoloader eliminated.
    * API CHANGE - columns must now be explictly declared, the class's
      public data members are not used.  That was silly.
    * rollback() now works.
    - is_changed() now returns a list of changed columns
